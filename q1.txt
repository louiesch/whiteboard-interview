Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

let string = "this is a string yay"

function urlify(str) {
  let url = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i].includes(" ")) {
      url.push("%20")
      } else {
        url.push(str[i])
      }
    }
  return url.join("");
}

console.log(urlify(string));
